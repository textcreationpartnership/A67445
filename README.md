SOME FEVV QUESTIONS CONCERNING THE OATH OF ALLEGIANCE, Propos'd by a Catholick Gentleman In a LETTER
1. To the Reader.

#####Body#####
THE OATH OF ALLEGIANCE.I A. B. Do truly and ſincerely Acknowledge, Profeſs, Testify, and Declare in 
    _ THE LETTER.

      * I. Why we, when our Laws ſo threatningly command, and our All is ſo nearly concern'd, may not ſafely and uncenſurably profeſs as much as They?

      * II. If there be reaſons enow to turn the Eye of Authority quite away from ſeeing what whole Univerſities ſo openly avow in the face of the world: are there not enow to Connive at us, who are but a few, and act privately, and not without the excuſing plea of extreme neceſſity?

      * III. Are thoſe two words, Impious and Heretical, ſo vaſtly different in their true and natural ſenſe, from the other half dozen, Falſe, Erroneous Contrary to the word of God, Pernicious, Seditious, Deteſtable, that all theſe ſix may voluntarily be affirm'd; and both thoſe, or at least, one of them, whatever ruine attends, muſt neceſſarily be deny'd?

      * IV. Why is it not Lawful for Engliſh Catholicks to be Loyal to their Prince, as far as the French to Theirs? Why is it not tolerable in Lay-men here to diſavow, what the stricteſt Religious there openly condemn? Strictest, I mean, in maintaining, and extending the Popes Prerogatives, and ſo moſt
 pertinent to our Queſtion: Shall Humane Motives be allow'd their place with Them who renounce the World, and not with thoſe who live in it?

      * V. If the Precept of Obedience to Kings in Temporals be a certain Catholick Doctrine, and the Exception (unleſſe the Pope depoſe) be incertain; whether the Precept does not still Oblige notwithſtanding that Exception?

      * VI. How can the Superinduced ſpiritual Obligation diminiſh the Civil, when no ſuch Condition is contain'd either in Baptiſm, Catechiſm, or Articles of Faith; Eſpecially ſince we are baptiz'd into the Communion of Believers, not of Opiners?

      * VII. Whether You have read any Authors that expreſſely ſay, a Magiſtrate ſo Circumſtantiated may be Depos'd by the Pope, eſpecially ſince I remember not one Instance, Ancient or Modern, of any ſuch Prince ſo treated?

      * VIII. Whether thoſe Examples may not all be reſolv'd, Either by the General Anſwer, that Fact makes no Right; Or, that they were practis'd without any ordinary and acknowledg'd Juriſdiction; but only by way of common Reaſon and natural Prudence, which teaches us in extremities to caſt about and relieve our ſelves, in the beſt and hopefullest way we can, according to our Circumſtances?

      * IX. What Eminent Writers there are, in the first thouſand years after Chriſt, who expreſly hold this Tenet of the Popes Authority to Depoſe Princes?

      * X. Whether any of theſe Poſitions deſerve the Condemnation of Heretical? That the Pope has a direct Dominion, both in Spirituals and Temporals, over all the World: Or that He can deprive Kings of their lives, and paſs ſentence of death against them: Or againſt the lives or goods of any other Perſon? that is, whether He can make it lawful to do thoſe Acts, which, were they not Authoriz'd by him, would be plain Murther, Theft, or Rebellion?

      * XI. What difference there is, as to any real effect in Government, between acknowledging a direct immediate Power in the Pope to Depoſe Princes, or only an indirect and mediate One?

      * XII. How do the Clergy, the Religious, & the Wiſer ſort of the Laity in other Countries behave themſelves, when the Pope makes War, or any other way Contends with their Soveraign Princes or States?
Thus Sir I have finiſh'd theſe few Queſtions; and hope by Your inſtruction to ſettle my mind: profeſ
